This project sets up a task management system which (after requesting a username and password) allows a user to select a number of options from the menu as follows:

On selection, a user will then be able to complete the respective service.

The framework of the code was provided by the Hyperion Bootcamp.

To this was added the ability to request a different username if a user tried to add one already in existence, and the facility to produce reports on tasks, and on specific users.

These were written to the task_overview.txt and user_overview.txt files respectively.

A summary of the information in the reports was also printed to the console, as below:

Any feedback or suggested improvements to this code would be gratefully received.

Thanks,

Toby
